Designed and implemented a visually engaging simulation of airplane motion using Python and Matplotlib, modeling multiple planes with distinct trajectory profiles and speeds.
Simulated realistic forward motion with customizable acceleration and altitude, incorporating equations of motion to calculate position, velocity, and speed over time for various scenarios. 
Created dynamic animations to depict airplane trajectories with color-coded paths, real-time progress updates, and interactive graphs for speed and distance analysis. 
Enhanced the visual and analytical experience with clear data visualization, including subplots for trajectory, time vs. distance, and speed vs. time, updated in real-time.
